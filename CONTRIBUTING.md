### Setting Up Your Environment

2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/mjsumpter/obsidian-tag-page.git`
3. Ensure you are on the `develop` branch: `git checkout develop`
4. Create a new branch for your changes off of `develop`: `git checkout -b [branch-name]`
5. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Describe your change here"`

## Style Guidelines

- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and meaningful commit messages that describe the change and its purpose.

## Review Process

After submitting a PR, a maintainer will review your contribution. They might ask for some changes or improvements before merging it into the `develop` branch. Please be patient and receptive to feedback. Periodically, changes from `develop` will be released to the `main` branch.
